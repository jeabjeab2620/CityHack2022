# AI for predicting future demand

# File
1. "0-24.h5": trained models. 0.h5 represents model for predicting demand between 00:00 to 00:50. 

# Design
1. trained using Neural Network Sequential model.
2. multiple models to predict different demand trend in each hour interval.
3. LSTM layers to relate long distanced nodes.
4. 3 hidden layers.

# Running the notebook
There are two parts commeneted 'option1' and 'option2'.
option1: train the model
option2: load models from trained model files
