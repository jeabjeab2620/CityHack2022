## Description of the Project (300 words)
Reduce surplus/shortage in medication production and avoid unnecessary waste due to expiration or underproduction which could endanger patients’ health with the help of ANN analytics on historical time-series datas and predict the future time-series. Also provides a large data regarding various medicines ad their alternatives and other necessary datas for general consumers. Possible future aspects to expand the datasets and have experts on real-time interactions to help connect like minded experts around the world. 

## 3 Most Impactful Features of the Project (with Screenshot and Short Description (150 words))
1. Historical and Future Predictive Time-Series Stamp
  - Using the given data on past sales and demand of all medicines produced by a certain company, our project trains the AI model to predict future demand of each medicine in a time-series manner. With such prediction available, effective medicine production in terms of manufactoring at full capacity - avoiding surplus and shortage - is possible. 
2. Data resource hub for all the medicines maybe used for research another prospectives
  - With in-depth analysis on medicine with factors including but not limited to amount of sales in specific time period, further development and/or preporation in relative and necessary area of medicine can be attained.
3. Open-source medical library for the public
  - Medical library allows public users to access each medicine's prescription details. 

## Tech used (as many as required)
1. Prediction model - Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) using LSTM 
2. UI development and web Development 
3. Regression model application to Neural Networks
4. AWS SageMaker and GPU Accelerators
